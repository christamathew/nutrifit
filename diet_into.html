<h2>Chronic Kidney Disease</h2>

<p>You need to have a kidney-friendly meal plan when you have chronic kidney disease (CKD). Watching what you eat and drink will help you stay healthier.Staying at a healthy weight and eating a balanced diet that is low in salt and fat can help you control your blood pressure. If you have diabetes, you can help control your blood sugar by carefully choosing what you eat and drink. 
Controlling high blood pressure and diabetes may help prevent kidney disease from getting worse.
A kidney-friendly diet may also help protect your kidneys from further damage. A kidney-friendly diet limits certain foods to prevent the minerals in those foods from building up in your body.

<h2>Coronary Artery Disease</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/321965/screenshots/4719391/dbbb.gif" style="float: left;margin-right:15px;">
<p>If you have coronary artery disease, the key to managing your condition could be as close as your kitchen. In fact, following a special diet for coronary artery disease is one of the most important steps you can take for healthier arteries.
Coronary artery disease -- or CAD for short -- occurs when fatty deposits, known as plaque, build up in the arteries. This causes them to narrow, restricting blood supply to the heart and brain. In some cases, these deposits may eventually block the artery entirely, resulting in a heart attack or stroke. 
The first tenet of a successful diet for coronary artery disease is avoiding foods that raise LDL cholesterol -- namely those that are rich in saturated fat, such as red meat, coconut oil, butter, cheese, and whole and 2 percent milk. You'll also want to skip foods that contain cholesterol-raising trans fats, like French fries, doughnuts, creamer, stick margarine, and shortening.</p>

<h2>Diabetes</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/325172/screenshots/4484740/bad-food.gif" style="margin-left:15px;float: right;">
<p>A diabetes diet simply means eating the healthiest foods in moderate amounts and sticking to regular mealtimes.
A diabetes diet is a healthy-eating plan that's naturally rich in nutrients and low in fat and calories. Key elements are fruits, vegetables and whole grains. 
A diabetes diet is based on eating three meals a day at regular times. This helps you better use the insulin that your body produces or gets through a medication.
Make your calories count with these nutritious foods. Choose healthy carbohydrates, fiber-rich foods, fish and "good" fats.</p>

<h2>Weight Loss</h2>
<img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ThreadbareParallelEmperorshrimp-small.gif" style="float: left;margin-right:15px;" >
<p>There are many ways to lose a lot of weight fast.
That said, many diet plans leave you feeling hungry or unsatisfied. These are major reasons why you might find it hard to stick to a diet.
However, not all diets have this effect. Low carb diets are effective for weight loss and may be easier to stick to than other diets.
Removing sugars and starches, or carbs, from your diet can reduce your appetite, lower your insulin levels, and make you lose weight without feeling hungry.
Assemble each meal out of a protein source, fat source, and low carb vegetables. This will generally put you in a carb range of 20–50 grams and significantly lower your hunger levels.
Having one day each week where you eat more carbs is acceptable, although not necessary.

<h2>Weight Gain</h2>

<p>Being underweight can be just as bad for your health as being obese.
Whether you’re clinically underweight or simply struggling to gain muscle weight, the main principles are the same.
Being underweight is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) below 18.5. It’s much more common in women and girls.
It’s very important to eat mostly healthy foods even when you’re trying to gain weight.
You need to eat more calories than your body burns to gain weight. Aim for 300–500 calories per day above your maintenance level for slow weight gain or 700–1,000 calories if you want to gain weight fast.
Protein forms the building blocks of your muscles. Eating sufficient protein is required to gain muscle weight instead of just fat.
To gain weight, eat at least three meals per day and make sure to include plenty of fat, carbs and protein.</p>
