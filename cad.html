    <h2>Portion Size</h2>
	<p>Remember how much you should be eating is as close as your hand!<br>
	<ul>

<li>3 oz lean protein, like fish or chicken = a deck of cards
<li>1 cup fresh fruit or vegetables = a tennis ball
<li>1 serving of potatoes, rice, or pasta = an ice cream scoop
<li>1 oz of peanut butter or cheese = your thumb</ul><br>
At mealtime, it also helps to eat from a salad plate rather than a full-size dinner plate. Fill up half your plate with vegetables and divide the other half between lean protein and grains or starch.</p>
